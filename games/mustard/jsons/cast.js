        <h2>About</h2>
        Jane Mustard is a very eccentric person who absolutely loves drinking SODA. Co. brand soda.
        She was named that way after her parent's two favourite things: mustard and the jane rose.
        She was born and raised in SODAville, a small city in the outskirts of Slough. <br>
        Her parents mysteriously died, and ever since she's been living alone in the house her
        parents left her, slowly covering it in various SODA. Co. merchandise. <br>
        After her parents died, became a professional rat hunter and earned several promotions for her outstanding performance
        in the field.

        <br><br>

        One day, after cracking open yet another SODA. Co. soda she realised that there was actually a dead rat inside of it.
        This infuriates Jane so much that she makes it her life goal to defeat the one in charge of SODA Co. as revenge, which
        kickstarts the events of the game "mustard".

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Despite being named after it, Jane has never properly tried mustard before.</li>
        <li>Jane is a big fan of "The Rolling Stones" and "Pierce The Veil", influenced by her parents during her childhood.</li>
        <li>The revolver that Jane wields in battle was given to her by her father, Arthur.</li>
        <li>Despite resenting SODA. Co. for ruining a good drink, Jane still holds SODA. Co. close to her heart.</li>
        <li>Jane does have access to the internet, but she chooses not to use it as she's seen way too many rats on there.</li>

        <h2>About</h2>

        Resept Chyonist is a calm, collected person that works for SODA. Co. as a receptionist. Not much is known is about her past
        apatt from the fact that she's been working for SODA. Co. for a really, really long time now. So much so that she's earned several employee
        of the month awards. She's incredibly hard-working and never fails to meet deadlines. Her name sounds oddly similar to "receptionist" because
        she comes from a long family of receptionists. It wasn't her original name, but she changed it to Resept to honour the ones that came before her. <br>
        Though she keeps to herself, her relationship with Undescript Vendor is widely known. Additionally, she was the one to request moving Undescript
        Vendor's office to the reception area so that they may be closer together.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Many other employees in SODA. Co. tease her for her name, but she doesn't mind.</li>
        <li>During her breaks, she likes playing cards with Undescript Vendor.</li>
        <li>She doesn't listen to music, instead enjoying the corporate tunes that are heard in the reception area.</li>

        <h2>About</h2>
        Undescript Vendor is a very relaxed person, slacking off on her job and being basically the complete opposite of Resept.
        They never gave her name out to anyone, so everyone just calls them by the name on the nametag: "Undescript Vendor".
        They still work under
        SODA. Co. but her job requires so little work that they get to sit and relax in her little pop-up shop now found in the reception area. <br>
        Little is known about what her actual job entails, but some coworkers theorise that they're involved in highly classified projects done by
        SODA. Co.. She pays no mind to these remarks and instead naps through whole days if nothing's happening.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>They really enjoy playing cards with Resept when possible.</li>
        <li>A lot of the items they sell she bring in herself from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>They have their own music taste, but ever since she was moved to the reception area they've stopped listening to songs that aren't the ones
        heard in the reception area.</li>
